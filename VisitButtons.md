For the buttons on the history screen

**Add Item button. Just add a new item to the visit**

**Invoice button. This will invoice the client for the visit. If the client pays for the visit straight away by selecting 'receipt invoice' on this screen then it will also show the payment screen. If the client has an account (ie pays at the end of the month), then don't select receipt invoice.**

**Payment button. You only need to click this if the client didn't previously pay when printing the invoice (see Invoice button), for example if they have to come back the next day to pay. Most people pay straight away so you don't need to click this button.**

**Consult type button. This lists some consultation types which you can then change. This is not often used.**
